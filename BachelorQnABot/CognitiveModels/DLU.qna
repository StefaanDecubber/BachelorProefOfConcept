# ? Is there a franchise that I have to pay in case of damage to my smartphone?

```markdown
During the leasing period all damage should be reported immediately. No contribution will be requested from the employee . In case of recurrent damage/not taking care of the device with due diligence, we will take action that might end up in paying a personal contribution.

At the end of the lease contract

, the smartphone must be returned free of damage, if not the repair cost will be charged to the end user. Use the smartphone cover and screen protector that delaware will provide to prevent end of lease damage.

# ? When my phone doesn't work, can I try to fix it myself?

```markdown
No! If your screen is broken, if you have water damage, if the smartphone doesn't load anymore, ... please do not try to fix it yourself ! By trying to fix it yourself, the insurance on the device will expire which means we won't be able to file an insurance claim.
